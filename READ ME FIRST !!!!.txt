CONTACT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - PYTHON

This project is a simple, GUI-based Contact Management System coded in Python, making it an ideal resource for beginners learning application development.

The system is focused on core data management, often referred to as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Users can easily add new contacts (including first name, last name, gender, address, and contact details), view them in a clear list, and delete any entry. To update a record, a user simply double-clicks the existing entry to edit the details.

The application ensures permanent data storage by utilizing an external database connection file. The source code is freely available for educational purposes.
